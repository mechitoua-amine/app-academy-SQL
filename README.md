## PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is a fast, feature-rich, open-source database application. It is a scalable application that we can use for development and production apps. We will be using PostgreSQL for most of our web-apps.A Brief History
SQL, short for Structured Query Language, was created in the early 1970s at IBM to manipulate and retrieve data in their database management system. In the late 1970s, Relation Software, Inc. (now Oracle Corporation) built on the SQL concepts from IBM to develop their own SQL-based relational database management system (RDBMS). In 1979, they introduced the first commercially-available implementation of SQL, Oracle V2.
